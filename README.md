# TENSORFLOW
In this example, we are using the MNIST dataset, which is a collection of handwritten digits. The code loads the dataset and preprocesses the images by reshaping them and normalizing the pixel values between 0 and 1.

Next, we define a simple neural network model using the Sequential API from TensorFlow's Keras module. The model consists of two dense layers: a hidden layer with 128 units and ReLU activation, and an output layer with 10 units (corresponding to the 10 digits) and softmax activation.

After defining the model, we compile it by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics to use during training.

We then train the model using the fit function, passing in the preprocessed training data, batch size, and number of epochs.

Finally, we evaluate the trained model on the test dataset using the evaluate function and print the test loss and accuracy.

You can modify this example according to your specific task and dataset. TensorFlow provides a wide range of APIs and functionalities for various machine learning tasks, including image classification, object detection, natural language processing, and more.
